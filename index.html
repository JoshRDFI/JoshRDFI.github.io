Joshua Rogers' Portfolio

<p>
	This page is to showcase many of the projects I have completed or am currently working on.
	Some projects were created through Western Governor's University (WGU) as part of my degree program - 
	Bachelor of Science, Data Management/Data Analytics.
	Other projects have been created while working towards a Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity, which is included within my WGU program.
	Various other projects are personal and/or educational but outside of my degree.
	The links below will take you to Python scripts, C++ programs, Jupyter Notebooks I have created, my Tableau Public page,
	and other projects I have worked on. I will also include my certifications.

	Thanks for checking this out.
