		This page is to showcase many of the projects I have completed or am currently working on.
		Some projects were created through Western Governors University (WGU) as part of my degree program -
		Bachelor of Science, Data Management/Data Analytics.
		Other projects have been created while working towards a Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity, which is included within my WGU program.
		Various other projects are personal and/or educational but outside of my degree.
		The links below will take you to Python scripts, C++ programs, Jupyter Notebooks I have created, my Tableau Public page,
		and other projects I have worked on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Included below the Projects sections are my current industry certifications. Each logo, when clicked, will take you to the verification
		page for each cert. Copy and paste the verification code from this page into the box on the new page.

		<li>Installing and running Llama on my local PC - no project page yet<br>
		<p>This is something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time. 
		Project page coming soon detailing what software was used and how it works. Future
		plans include adding training with my own data, adding offline voice commands/prompting and an avatar that 
		provides the results through text to speech. </p>

				Udacity Machine Learning Project 1
			</a>
			<p>This project explores how to create a supervised machine learning model to determine
				which people would make good donors for a charity. The data is provided and comes 
				in a CSV file derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated 
				by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the 
				Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article 
				by Ron Kohavi online.

				Udacity Data Modeling With Postgres
			</a>
			<p>
				In this project a database of all the songs and artists played by users on the Sparkify platform was created with ETL processes.
				The database software chosen was PostgreSQL. Python was chosen as the language to extract the data
				from the JSON files and import it into the database. Additionally, Python is used to create the database and its associated tables.
