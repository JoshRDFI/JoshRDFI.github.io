			This page is to showcase many of the projects I have completed or am currently working on.
			Some projects were created through Western Governors University (WGU) as part of my degree program -
			Bachelor of Science, Data Management/Data Analytics.
			Other projects have been created while working towards a Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity, which is included within my WGU program.
			Various other projects are personal and/or educational but outside of my degree.
			The links below will take you to Python scripts, C++ programs, Jupyter Notebooks I have created, my Tableau Public page,
			and other projects I have worked on or am currently working on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Included below the Projects sections are my current industry certifications. Each logo, when clicked, will open a new window with the
			verification page for each cert. Copy and paste the verification code from this page into the box on the new page.

					Installing and running an AI on my local PC

				<p>
					This is something I've wanted to be able to do for a long time. This project page
					will detail what software was used and how it works.
					<br>
					Future plans include adding training with my own data, adding offline voice
					commands/prompting and an avatar that provides the results through text to speech.
					<br> Will be updated soon!

					"A Free, Open Source Course on Communicating with Artificial Intelligence"<br>
					I learned a lot, followed by experimentation on how different levels of information within 
					questions posed to ChatGPT changed the results. I also participate on the <a class="plainlink" href="https://community.towardsai.net/">
					Towards AI</a> discord server to refine my knowledge and learn the latest methods of prompting.
					The examples page linked above includes	some of the prompts I have used on ChatGPT and Dall-E and the results.

						<li>
							<a>Machine Learning Project 2</a>
							<p>
								This project is this page. The goal is to have my personal Github page reviewed to determine
								how to looks compared to other personal pages in my profession and make suggested changes, if any.

								Udacity Machine Learning Project 1
							</a>
							<p>
								This project explores how to create a supervised machine learning model to determine
								which people would make good donors for a charity. The data is provided and comes
								in a CSV file derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

					Udacity R Programming Bicycle Data Exploration
				</a>
				<p>
					This course taught programming and visualizations in R Studio using GGPlot2. The course provided bicycle rental csv files
					that informed the 3 questions I had to develop and answer, both through visualizations and a statistical summary. <br />

					Airport Delays Project on Tableau Public
				</a>
				<p>
					In this course, I learned how to use Tableau (Public) and created a Tableau dashboard
					to explore flight data provided within the course. The data was provided in 3 CSV files
					and I had to determine what questions to ask. These questions would inform the creation of the dashboard.<br />

					Udacity Data Modeling With Postgres
				</a>
				<p>
					In this project a database of all the songs and artists played by users on the Sparkify platform was created with ETL processes.
					The database software chosen was PostgreSQL. Python was chosen as the language to extract the data
					from the JSON files and import it into the database. Additionally, Python is used to create the database and its associated tables.<br />
