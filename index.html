<p>
	This page is to showcase many of the projects I have completed or am currently working on.
	Some projects were created through Western Governors University (WGU) as part of my degree program - 
	Bachelor of Science, Data Management/Data Analytics.
	Other projects have been created while working towards a Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity, which is included within my WGU program.
	Various other projects are personal and/or educational but outside of my degree.
	The links below will take you to Python scripts, C++ programs, Jupyter Notebooks I have created, my Tableau Public page,
	and other projects I have worked on. </p>
<p>
	Included below the Projects sections are my current industry certifications. Each logo, when clicked, will take you to the verification
	page for each cert. Copy and paste the verification code from this page into the box on the new page.

	This page was developed in part while taking the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. Thanks for checking this out.
