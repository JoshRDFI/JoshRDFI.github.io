	This page is to showcase my completed projects through WGU as part of my degree program, Udacity while working towards a Data Analyst Nanodegree, and various other projects. The links below will take you to the Jupyter Notebooks I created, my Tableau Public page, or other programs I have developed.

Thanks for checking this out.
